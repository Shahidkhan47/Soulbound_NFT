# DAO Smart Contract

## Overview
This Solidity-based smart contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) where users can create proposals and participate in voting. Each proposal has a voting period, and participants can vote either for or against the proposal. 

The contract includes features such as:
- Proposal creation with an expiration time.
- Voting on active proposals.
- Retrieving proposal details and vote tallies.
- Checking if a user has voted on a specific proposal.

## Features

- **Proposal Creation**: Anyone can create a proposal by providing a descriptive text and an expiration time.
- **Voting**: Users can cast votes either in favor or against the proposal.
- **Vote Tallying**: View the total votes cast , in favor of proposal and against a proposal.
- **Time Checking**: Check how much time is left before a proposal expires.
- **Voter Status**: Determine whether a user has already voted on a particular proposal.
- **Proposal Listing**: Fetch the list of all proposalIDs created.

## Contract Functions

### 1. `proposalCreation(string memory _proposal_text, uint _expiration_time) external returns (bytes32)`
Creates a new proposal and emits a `ProposalCreated` event.

**Parameters**:
- `_proposal_text`: Description text of the proposal.
- `_expiration_time`: The time (in seconds) when voting on this proposal ends.

**Returns**:
- `_iden`: The unique identifier for the proposal (created using `keccak256`).

### 2. `vote(bytes32 _iden, bool _vote) external`
Casts a vote for a specific proposal and emits a `VoteCast` event.

**Parameters**:
- `_iden`: The unique identifier of the proposal.
- `_vote`: `true` for a vote in favor of the proposal, `false` for a vote against.

### 3. `proposalDetails(bytes32 _iden) external view returns (address, string memory, uint)`
Fetches the details of a specific proposal.

**Returns**:
- The proposal creator’s address.
- The proposal’s descriptive text.
- The expiration time for the proposal.

### 4. `checkTime(bytes32 _iden) public view returns (uint, bool)`
Checks how much time is left before voting on a proposal ends.

**Returns**:
- The remaining time (in seconds) for the proposal.
- `true` if voting is still open.

### 5. `voterCheck(bytes32 _iden, address _voter) external view returns (bool)`
Checks whether a specific voter has already voted on a particular proposal.

**Returns**:
- `true` if the voter has voted, otherwise `false`.

### 6. `getVoteTallying(bytes32 _iden) external view returns (uint, uint, uint)`
Retrieves the vote tally for a specific proposal.

**Returns**:
- The total number of votes cast.
- The number of votes in favor of the proposal.
- The number of votes against the proposal.

### 7. `fetchIds() external view returns (bytes32[] memory)`
Fetches the identifiers of all the proposals created.

**Returns**:
- A list of all proposal IDs.

## Events

### 1. `ProposalCreated(bytes32 _identifier, address proposal_creator)`
Emitted when a new proposal is created.

### 2. `VoteCast(address voter, bytes32 _identifier)`
Emitted when a vote is cast on a proposal.

## Usage

1. **Create a Proposal**: Call the `proposalCreation` function with a description text and expiration time.
2. **Vote on a Proposal**: Call the `vote` function with the proposal ID and your vote (for or against).
3. **Check Results**: Use functions like `proposalDetails`, `getVoteTallying`, and `checkTime` to see proposal information and vote counts.
